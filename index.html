    <li>&frac12; cup sugar </li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li> 1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup warm water </li>
    <li>12 cups water</li>
    <li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>

  <h2>
    Instructions
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl mix the yeast and warm water and stir. Let sit for 5 minutes until yeast dissolves.</li>
    <li>In the bowl of your mixer, add flour, salt, cardamom, and cinnamon and mix. Add vegetable oil, egg, coconut milk, sugar and yeast mixture.</li>
    <li>Using the hook attachment mix everything until the dough is not too sticky and it does no longer stick to the side of the bowl, add additional flour as needed.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about an hour until the dough rises a bit.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a frying pan, or a wok works well for this.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough in about 6 pieces to make it easier to roll and cut. Roll each piece so that the dough is about 1 cm (less than 1/2 inch) in thickness.<br/> 
      Cut into triangles and place in hot oil. Fry on both sides. Place donuts on paper towels to soak up the oil. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with powder sugar and enjoy.</li>
